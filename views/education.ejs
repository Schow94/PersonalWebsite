        <p>I studied Molecular Cellular Developmental Biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz from 2012-2016. I am a scientist/biologist by training but I have recently discovered a newfound passion for coding. Some resources I've used for learning are Code Academy, FreeCodeCamp, and Colt Steele's "Online Web Development Bootcamp" course on Udemy.</p>
